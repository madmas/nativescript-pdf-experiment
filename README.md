# PDFmake on NativeScript

Sample to use PDFMake on Native Script.

Adopted some code from https://github.com/kumarandena/nativescript-pdf-generation in order to provide a working sample for current NativeScript version.


PDFmake docs: https://pdfmake.github.io/docs/0.3/


Had no luck with jsPDF due to some reference error when jsPDF tries to bin atob and btoa functions.
